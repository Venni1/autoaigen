# Automatic AI generation platform
###### Thanks to Heyselcuk AI for inspiring me!
## Prerequisities
- Visual Studio 2019 Community with ASP.NET Core
- Python 3.10.0
- Basic Python and HTML knowledge
- A good GPU (e.g. the NVIDIA RTX 4090)
- For packages for Python ask ChatGPT
# IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD GPU, THE GENERATION TAKES A LONG TIME!
## Setup
1. Open the "front" folder with Visual Studio
2. Open a terminal and run `cd back` and then run `python index.py`
3. (not needed) Open the "index.py" file in whatever code editor you want to use and tweak the model by changing the variables on the top of the file and by tweaking the code (it waits 1 second per image)
4. In Visual Studio click the unfilled green arrow on the top, it launches the server and your web browser
5. Enjoy!
